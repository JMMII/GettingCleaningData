##Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project

###This ReadMe.md file explains the Final Project.

##Helping the Reviewer
####Load the data using the following command:
####data <- read.table("./FinalProjDataOut.txt",header=TRUE,quote="")

####The resulting dataset should be 180 observations with 68 variables, where the first two columns are identifier variables, SubjectID and ActivityID. SubjectID are integers ranging from 1 to 30. Each Subject performed six Activities, as denoted by the plain language activity name within ActivityID. 

####To replicate the analysis described within the Code Book, the associated R script, Run_Analysis.R, assumes all files from that .zip file have been downloaded and stored into the working directory. That is, there are no files within subfolders of the working directory. 

As stated in the instructions for this final project, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for analysis. 

The output from the project was to write the data back out to a new txt file that I called FinalProjDataOut.txt
